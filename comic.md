lets discuss laying out our scenes and the animated element

"between scenes either 'therefore' for 'but'" - Trey Parker


## Panel 1: The Mistake

Visual

> door with sign above, 'Approvals' in a corporate office setting, simple

A bored clerk at a mega-corporate desk rubber-stamps contracts. 

> contracts roll across on conveyor belt
> stamp, stamp, stamp

Wayne appears in window above, drops paper, it falls on the treadmill

## Panel 2: The Mistake

> head slids up in window, paper falls down, show paper landing on conveyor belt

The name line clearly reads **WAYNE MO**. She stamps it anyway.

> topdown over paper on conveyor belt, stamp appears, stamps slids out, 'approved'

“Approved.”

Dialog (clerk, deadpan)

Small text on form

“Fleet Control Access: FULL”

## Panel 3: Wayne, the Guy

Wayne Mo in a cramped apartment. Hoodie, coffee, mismatched socks. His laptop PINGS like a slot machine jackpot.

> mattress on floor
> phone on bed
> zoom

Phone notification

"You have been approved.

Welcome, Fleet Administrator."

notification number increases comically fast

## Panel 4: Operators Guide

> Mail flies into the room through slot

Operators manual

super short emoji / symbol guide to game

> operators manual slides down to reveal Wayne (smiling, a little scared).

## Tone Notes

- Comedy first, not lore-heavy
- Wayne is competent by accident
- Visual clarity over exposition

## What the Player Learns Instantly

- You control intersections, not cars
- The city is the puzzle
- Wayne Mo snuck into this position

## Next Step

- ultra-minimal panel planning

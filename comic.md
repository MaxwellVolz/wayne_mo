- add Framer Motion

on load of the app add...

1. Title Intro - like a modern game loading screen
   1. transition in a placeholder svg centered dvh and w
   2. transition out
2. keep the screen black, have carousel of images with forward/backward buttons in bottom corners and close button in top left
   1. images fit width and will be 1080x1080 like instagram
   2. images will contain one base image
      1. 1-3 'animated components' that will use a framer motion transition 

lets discuss laying out our scenes and the animated element

"between scenes either 'therefore' for 'but'" - Trey Parker


## Panel 1: The Mistake


corporate office

--- 

door with sign above, 'Approvals' in a corporate office setting, simple

A bored clerk at a mega-corporate desk rubber-stamps contracts. 
contracts roll across on conveyor belt
Wayne appears in window above, drops paper, it falls on the treadmill

---

paper is stamped


## Panel 2: Wayne, the Guy

Mail  flies into Waynes hand the room through slot
Present drops in background

## Tone Notes

- Comedy first, not lore-heavy
- Wayne is competent by accident
- Visual clarity over exposition

## What the Player Learns Instantly

- You control intersections, not cars
- The city is the puzzle
- Wayne Mo snuck into this position

## Next Step

- ultra-minimal panel planning

# Game Data

This directory contains static game data:

- **roads.ts** - Road graph definitions (nodes and paths)
- **zones.ts** - Interaction zones (pickup/dropoff locations)
- **map.ts** - 8x8 city block layout

Road paths should be authored manually or exported from Blender as Vector3 point arrays.
